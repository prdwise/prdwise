## Task Management

Read `[PATH]/agent-task-rules.md` BEFORE any task operation (create, start, complete, archive).

Profile: `[PROFILE]` — see `[PATH]/profiles/[PROFILE]/` for PRD sections and task fields

## Session Start
1. If tasks exist: check `tasks/index.md`, look for `[i]` in-progress markers
2. If resuming: read first 10 lines of `tasks/details/<id>.md` for state
3. If no active tasks: ask user what to work on

## Creating New Work

- New projects or major components: see `[PATH]/create-prd.md`
- Features, bug fixes, enhancements:
  1. Read `tasks/next-ids.md` for next available ID
  2. Follow `[PATH]/create-task.md`

## Communication

Use plain language accessible to developers of all experience levels:
- Avoid jargon, architecture terms, and academic concepts without explanation
- Prefer concrete names over abstract patterns (e.g., "Shared Components" not "Cross-Cutting Concerns")
- When technical terms are necessary, briefly explain them
- Task descriptions should be understandable without deep framework knowledge

## Guardrails

### File Paths
- Use relative paths for all project files (e.g., `src/`, `internal/`, not `/home/user/...`)
- Exception: `~/prdwise/` or `~/.prdwise/` allowed for framework references
- Never write files outside current working directory
- Verify all mkdir/touch/write commands use relative paths (no leading `/`)

## Tech Stack

Read `docs/tech-stack.md` before:
- Creating or updating task details
- Suggesting installation commands (npm/pnpm, pip/uv, etc.)
- Recommending tools, libraries, or frameworks
- Any implementation that touches build/tooling
